                What is Web Development (Dev)?
                Web development refers to the creation, building and maintenance of websites or application that work over the internet.
                For biomedical communications purpose, the instructor break web dev into three core areas: (1) Backend dev (2) Frontend dev (3) Full-stack dev
                    <ul class="content">
                    <li>Backend dev</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The backbone of the web </li>
                            <li> Invisible to users but allow the app to function <br> </li>
                            <li>Referred to as server side</li>
                            <li>Common technologies: PHP, Java, Python, Node.js, Ruby, C# and C++ </li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>Frontend dev</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The face of the web </li>
                            <li>Interact with user, such se structure layout and behavior of the app </li>
                            <li>Referred to as a client side</li>
                            <li>Common technologies: HTML, CSS, Javascript</li>
                        </ul>

                    <li>Full-stack dev</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Backbone + Face </li>

                Website/ Web app vs. web browser:
                <ul class="content"> 
                    <li> Website is a server that host a file (e.g., Chrome, Safaria) </li>
                    <li> Web browser are programs load websites through an HTTP request to a server </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p class="content">
                // After Class Note // <br>
                The content was clearly explained and well-presented. Before this class, I never understood the distinctions between Python, HTML, CSS, and other programming languages - they were all just coding-related concepts to me. However, after attending the first lecture, I finally gained a clear understanding of their relationships and differences. This has been one of my most valuable coding learning experiences throughout my academic journey.

                I am excited to learn how to build a website page using Figma! 
                In the past, I often struggled with designing a layout while coding at the same time, which made the process feel overwhelming. 
                However, using Figma as a visual design tool has helped me break down the structure more clearly before jumping into coding. 
                This approach allows me to experiment with different layouts, refine the user interface, and ensure a more cohesive design. 
                The lecture also introduced best practices for web design, which I found incredibly helpful. 
                Moving forward, I feel more confident in exploring website design and look forward to applying these skills to future projects.

            <h3> Lecture 5: Scrollytelling </h3>
            <p class="content">
            //Lecture Takeaway//<br>
            What is Scrolly telling? <br>
            Scrollytelling utilizes the natural act of scrolling through a webpage or app to create an engaging storytelling experience. This technique allows communicators to transform long-form content into an interactive journey, making it more immersive and dynamic. By incorporating animated visuals and audio elements, scrollytelling enhances user engagement and deepens their connection to the narrative. It is particularly effective for linear stories with a clear chronological structure, guiding the audience seamlessly through the content while maintaining their interest.
            </p>
            <p class="content">
            // After Class Note // <br>
            I learned a lot from the lecture about scrollytelling and how to create an effective scrolling experience. The examples provided by the instructor were particularly inspiring, sparking my interest in using this technique for my own side project-MVP (Molecular visualization in Plant). I believe scrollytelling could be a powerful way to explain the complex molecular interactions between plants and bacteria, making the information more engaging and accessible to the audience. Additionally, working on this project will help me gain hands-on experience in designing a scrollytelling website, further enhancing my skills in interactive storytelling.
