            <p class="content">
                In our first meeting, we brainstorming various interactive educational models designed to enhance learning in biomedical science. 
                The discussion focused on utilizing 3D-printed interactive models and digital applications to create engaging, hands-on experiences. The proposed topics cover ecosystem dynamics, molecular interactions, reproduction, and immune responses, each offering a unique way to visualize complex biological and environmental processes. Below is a summary of the key ideas discussed.
            <ul class="content">
                <li>
                Ecosystem: Add different factors caused from human activity to observe the ecosystem changes.

            <h3> Research and Discussion </h3>
            <p class="content">
            The discussion focused on key elements of the island ecosystem project. The project plans to include different island types with 3D-printed puzzle pieces featuring scannable images for an AR experience. Coral bleaching and mangrove ecosystems were highlighted, emphasizing their role in biodiversity, coastal protection, and economic and cultural value. A central island piece will allow users to "plant" mangroves to explore their positive impact. Negative elements include a fishing boat representing fish population depletion and ghost gear, as well as the effects of wind farms and industrial agriculture, such as habitat loss, soil degradation, and algae blooms that disrupt marine life. The project will feature four effector pieces: mangrove planting (positive), wind farms (negative impact on birds and bats), fishing boats (negative impact on fish populations and plastic pollution), and coral reef nurseries (illustrating shading effects). The island piece will have divots for attaching interactive elements, with potential AR integration if time allows.

            Summary of the four effectors:

            <ul>
                <li>Mangrove planting: Enhances coastal ecosystems by providing nursery grounds for marine life, reducing erosion, and protecting against natural disasters.
                </li>
                <li> Coral reef nursery: Supports coral restoration efforts, though shading in nurseries can impact coral growth.
                </li>
                <li>
                Wind farm: Impacts bird and bat populations, potentially disrupting local ecosystems.
                </li>
                <li>
                Industrial fishing: Leads to fish population depletion, disrupts the food chain, and introduces ghost gear (abandoned fishing equipment).

            <h3> Storyboard and Deveopler Walkthrough </h3>
            <p class="content">
            I was assigned to create the development walkthrough and storyboard for the project. It felt quite challenging, but I saw it as an opportunity to practice storyboarding and refine my walkthrough development skills. Thankfully, Max volunteered to join me in working on the development, which was a huge help.  Before starting the paperwork, Max and I spent two hours discussing the project's interaction and visual elements to ensure we were aligned when working on the dev walkthrough together. I learned a lot from Max during our discussion—watching them sketch while explaining their ideas was incredibly inspiring, and I truly appreciated the collaboration. It has always been a dream of mine to work this way. 
            Here are some drafts Max created during our discussion, which helped keep us on the same page and made our conversation more efficient:

            </div>
            <p class="content">
            Looking back our discussion, one thing we could improve in the future is holding a quick follow-up meeting to share our ideas with the rest of the team. At the time, we didn’t explain everything to everyone since they were too busy to gather on short notice. Even after some teammates spoke with the instructor, I was still unsure if the ideas Max and I proposed were fully confirmed by everyone. Given the tight timeline—and the fact that I was also traveling back to Taiwan—Max and I decided to outline the dev walkthrough and storyboard first. This allowed us to set placeholders and rough content, making it easier to adjust later if any ideas changed.
            </p>
            <p class="content">
            I prepared the descriptions for the dev walkthrough based on our discussion, while Max created the wireframes and images for the document. Max also designed the main island image for the storyboard, and I continued developing the rest. I challenged myself to draw as quickly as possible to submit a draft for one round of feedback before the deadline. While sketching, I focused on making the images simple and clear so that Naomi and I, as modelers, could efficiently build the necessary 3D assets within our limited timeframe. From the feedback, I learned the importance of incorporating interactive elements into the storyboard and emphasizing user interaction in the visuals. Initially, I approached the storyboard as I would for an animation, focusing more on sequential visuals rather than user engagement. However, after receiving feedback, I realized that including user interactions helps clarify how each visual element fits into the project. This approach not only improves communication within the team but also ensures a smoother development process.

            <h3> 3D Assets Creation </h3>
            <p class="content">
            Today, Naomi and I worked together at UTM with the goal of completing all the 3D assets. We wanted to have everything ready for Jeah, our amazing developer, so they would have more time to explore Unity. I was responsible for creating and animating the boat, coral reef, palm tree, land, and ocean, as well as integrating all the assets into the final scene. Naomi took on the remaining assets, including the bird, bat, fish, and mangroves. All models follow our design style guide, meaning they are low-poly and need to be structured in a way that allows for proper exploration and display within the project.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4> i) Problem and Solution: </h3>
            <p class="content">
                <h5> Problem 01: </h5>
                The first problem I face is how to effectively indicate that the boat is a fishing boat? I needed a way to clearly communicate that the boat was a fishing vessel without spending too much time on modeling. Using a string was problematic—it could not be too thick, or it would not look like a string, but if it was too thin, it would be hard to see on the final screen. Creating a net was another option, but it would have been too time-consuming.
                <br>
                <h5> Solution 01: </h5>
                Instead of using a string or net, I decided to model a metal chain for the boat. This effectively represents its function while addressing the visibility and modeling concerns.
            </p>
            <p class="content">
                <h5> Problem 02: </h5>
                I initially tried to create an anchor and metal chain with a hook by extruding shapes from an AI file. However, the extrusion process resulted in weird faces, and when I exported the boat as an OBJ file, the spaces between each chain link and hook closed incorrectly. The anchor also did not function as expected.
                <br>
                <h5>Solution 02: </h5>
                To fix this, I recreated the chain and hook directly in Maya, which resolved the issue. I also decided to exclude the anchor since it was not a key asset. My main takeaway from this challenge is that if a model is not too complex, it's often best to create it entirely in Maya. If I do start from an AI file, I need to minimize the number of points in the shape to avoid extrusion issues.

            <br>
            <h4> ii) Adjustment and Refinements </h3>
            <p class="content">
            I reused a coral reef asset I had previously created for another project. However, the original model included detailed textures and was designed with smooth shading applied in Maya, as it didn't need to be exported. For this project, the coral reef had to be exported as a low-poly model without smooth shading. I revisited the original Maya file and modified the model to meet these requirements. I applied the same polygon reduction process to the palm tree model as well.

            <br>
            <h4> iii) New things I learned: </h3>
            <h5> Create polygon in Maya </h5>
            <p class="content">
            I usually start modeling from a cube, but for the low-poly rocks, I learned a new technique from an online tutorial. Instead of starting with a cube, I drew a polygon plane and extruded it in Maya. This method is useful for creating irregular shapes, and I'll consider using it in future projects when working with organic or non-standard forms.

            <p class="content">
            While working on the wave asset, I also explored different ways to animate the waves in Maya. I tested two approaches for generating wave textures and animations:
            <br>    
            - Texture deformer: For a regular, repeating wave pattern, Used Deform → Texture → Ocean to create consistent wave motion (F2)
            <br>
            - Wave deformer: For a more controllable wave animation, Used Deform → Nonlinear → Wave Deformer to customize the wave behavior (F3)

                In our project, we plan to implement two wave states:
                <br>
                - Large, powerful waves when no mangroves are present on the island.
                <br>
                - Smaller, more regular waves when mangroves are planted, demonstrating their role in wave reduction.

            To keep the workflow simple, we decided to use aiStandard textures in Maya. Since the island is designed to represent a tropical environment, the previous scene had too few coral reefs. To enhance the scene, I added more coral reef clusters using MASH, allowing for efficient duplication and distribution.

            <h3> Cleanup and Prepare Wireframe for Developer </h3>
            <p class="content">
            Max initially created the wireframe in Figma in early February, but as new ideas emerged over the weeks, the design was never fully settled or confirmed. Additionally, the layer organization in Figma was not well-structured, which would have made it more time-consuming for the developer to extract UI assets.
            After discussing these issues in our group meeting and considering our time constraints, we decided that Max would finalize the wireframe flow while I took on the task of cleaning up and reorganizing the Figma file no later than this week. 
            <br>
            <br>
            I also replaced the existing UI elements, which did not match the style guide with the assets created by Anaiah earlier in the project to ensure consistency throughout the app. 
            Additionally, I adjusted the Splash screen color to a more blueish tone, giving it a modern and playful look.
            <br>
            <br>
            This was an unexpected extra task in our plan, and cleaning up the files took more time than I anticipated. I had to locate where each image was placed, understand the hierarchy of layers and parent groups, and deal with multiple assets that had the same naming, making differentiation difficult. The biggest takeaway from this experience is that when working in a team, we should always consider who will be handling the files next. "Being mindful" of file organization from the start can save time for others and make collaboration much more efficient.

            <p class="content">
            On Thursday, David introduced us to the 3D printing machine at BMC. The next day, I tested the process using the boat model I created for this project, and it turned out really well! Huge-thanks to David for his help!
            <h4> Key considerations Before Printing:</h4>
            - Ensure that no normal faces are reversed.
            <br>
            - Make sure each part of the model is mostly attached to the main structure to prevent it from detaching during printing.
            <br>
            - Position delicate details, such as the logo on the boat, facing upward in the pre-printing software to avoid support materials attaching to the surface.
            <br>
            - Slightly tilt the object to minimize the amount of support material required. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Initially, Naomi planned to create the 3D island model and fact pieces, while I was responsible for the printing process. 
            However, she wanted to try the 3D printing process herself, so she took on the  actual 3D-printing model for the project instead.

            <h3> Animate 3D assets & Export FBX files for Developer </h3>
            <p class="content">
            The animation process is always the most exciting part for me, but it can also be quite challenging at times. For this project, I animated the boat, fish, and bird using motion paths, constraining them to loop around the island. To animate the planting of young mangroves, I used MASH, allowing each mangrove to appear individually and be planted into the ground.
            For the wave animation, we decided to create it directly in Unity, as it would be easier for the developer to control both the wave movement and texture changes.
            This was my first time exporting animated objects using motion paths and deformers, and I initially didnt realize that I needed to bake all the animations before exporting. After looking into it, I followed this tutorial on baking animations for FBX files:
            </p>
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1by3RRNIgdY" target ="_blank" style="color: #000"> Link: Bake animation for FBX files </a>
            <p>
            Once I baked the animations and exported them as FBX files, I tested them on Sketchfab before handing them off to the developer. The first issue I encountered was that the textures were not visible on Sketchfab, but fortunately, Jeah confirmed that they appeared correctly in Unity. 
            The second issue was that the mangrove animation did not function as expected. After researching the issue, I learned that MASH animations need to be converted to an instancer before baking.
            With these adjustments, the animations are now correctly exported and ready for use in Unity (maybe....).
            </p>
            <p> 
            I followed this tutorial to resolve the issue:

            <h3> Revised the animation </h3>
            <p class="content">
            In the previous version, the mangrove planting animation still felt unnatural, so I asked Marc for suggestions. Marc demonstrated how to use offset and the visual MASH node in Maya to improve the planting animation, making it look smoother and more natural.
            
            <h4> Wave Animation Issue & Solutions </h4>
            <p>
            After this week's group meeting, we decided to animate the wave in Maya instead of Unity. The texture of the wave in Unity didn’t match the style of the other assets, and creating a controllable wave in Unity seemed challenging.
            Based on my exploration from February 28, I created the wave using Wave Deformer and Texture Deformer, then keyframed the frequency. However, I made the mistake of not testing the wave animation on Sketchfab before sending it to Jeah. A few days later, we realized that Wave Deformer and Texture Deformer cannot be baked into an FBX file, causing the animation to break.
            </p>
            <h4> Potential Solutions: </h4>
            <h5> 01 Animate the wave in Unity (back to Jeah's approach)</h5>
            • Pros: Would avoid the baking issue.
            <br>
            • Cons: The wave texture might not match the other assets, and the surface texture could block the coral and fish underneath. Also, animating the wave impact would add extra workload for Jeah.
            <h5> 02 Manually bend and keyframe each stage of the wave in Maya </h5>
            • Pros: Ensures consistency in style and visibility of underwater assets.
            <br>
            • Cons: Requires patience and time to keyframe each stage smoothly.
            <br>
            <br>
            Decision: Test Solution 2 and see if it produces a smooth and natural wave motion.

            <br>
            <h4>
            I followed these steps to create and export the wave animation as an FBX file:
            </h4>
            <p>
            - Use deformers to shape and control the wave frequency.
            - Copy each stage of the wave animation separately.
            - Blend the stages into a single object.
            - Keyframe each bending stage.
            - Bake the bend animation.
            - Export as an FBX file.
            </p>
            <p>
            To ensure Jeah has enough time to embed the big wave, small wave, and contaminated wave animations in Unity, I aimed to complete them today. To save time, I kept the animation loop short, ensuring the wave shape at the start and end matched a neutral position. This way, the loop would feel more seamless.
            Finally, I finished the different wave types. They weren’t perfectly smooth, but they were functional and ready to be passed on to Jeah. After a quick test in Unity, the waves seemed to be working fine!
            </p>
            <h4>Developer Feedback:</h4>
            <br>
            •	Instead of creating four separate wave animations, I could try making one long animation with all variations in a single file, making it easier to control in Unity.
            <br>
            •	Next time, I should rename object layers and texture files in Maya to prevent naming conflicts, which can cause issues when reading the files in Unity.
